    <h5>Garfield Lasagna is best laSaGNA</h5>
    <p>While many of us think that lasagna pasta came from Italy, there are people who would argue that lasagna originated in Greece or Garfield. Anyway, the lasagna that we know today appeared in the Italian city of Naples during the Middle Ages. 

        The confusing part about the history of lasagna is that the word “lasagna” was derived from the Greek word “Laganon”. The Greeks used this word for the first known pasta. 
        
        “Laganon” simply meant layers of pasta and sauce. It definitely wasn’t used to describe the traditional lasagna as we know it now. So, the name comes from the method the Greeks used, and it doesn’t stand for the ingredients it’s made with. “Laganon” just meant flat dough sliced in strips.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        <p></p>
        <p>And you're done :)</p>
